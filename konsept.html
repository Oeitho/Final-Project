        <h2>The productname</h2>
      	<p> The productname unit is cylindrical in shape and designed to fit inside the seatpost of most bicycles. The upper part of the unit consists of a vibration sensor, a GPS activated by the sensor and a transceiver to communicate with the app, website and keyring. </p>
        <p>The lower part consists of AA-battery and a plug to hold the unit safe inside the seatpost. When it’s due for a battery change, you’ll get a notification through the app, then it’s as simple as taking off the seat post and plug, then slide out the unit to replace the battery.
        The unit’s default mode is standby, but activates when sufficient movement is detected and alerts the user through the keyring device, app or both showing the significance of movement detected. </p>

        <h2>Keyring</h2>
        <p> Productname comes with a keyring already paired with the unit. It’s simple in design and it’s job is to alert the user if any significant vibration has been detected. When the Keyring Device is within 2 meters of the unit, the unit will remain in standby as to not issue any false alarms whenever you’re riding your bike. It contains a coin-size battery, receiver, notification light and a reset button. The light uses three different colours to warn the owner of their severity of the vibration detected. After the notification light is lit, you may turn off the light by pressing the reset button.</p>
        <p>
        - A light yellow color indicates caution and that something has happened to the bike in such a way that the user might be advised to have a look, but that most likely nothing has happened.<br/>
        - An orange light indicates that something has likely happened and it is advised that you visually check on your bike.<br/>
        - A red light indicates an immediate warning that major movement has occurred and it’s highly advised that you visually check your bike or that you track it through the website or app.<br/>
