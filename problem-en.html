					<h2>Problem</h2>
	        <p>
	        	Many people use bike as transportation, which is endorsed by the Norwegian transportation authorities and organisations. In 2012 they prepared a proposal for improving and developing a healthy Norwegian transportation plan in order to achieve the climate goals set. The proposal states the necessity to reduce emissions from vehicles, ships and aircraft. Furthermore, increased biking and walking promotes accessibility, health and environment.<sup><a href="#sources">1</a></sup>
					<p>
						However, there are several challenges associated with bikes as means of transportation as every third person in Norway has experienced a bike theft.<sup><a href="#sources">2</a></sup> The police reported 4837 thefts of bikes in 2015, in Oslo alone.<sup><a href="#sources">3</a></sup> In addition, most bike thefts are assumingly never reported. These facts might lower the chances of people actually choosing their bike as a mean of transportation due to the fear of it being stolen.

						There are a number of good advices on how to prevent or minimize the risk of getting your bike stolen, such as; <br /><br />
						<strong>
						- Register the bike in an official bike registry.<sup><a href="#sources">4</a></sup><br /><br />
						</strong>
						<strong>
						- Lock the frame and both front and rear wheels to a rack.<br /><br />
						</strong>
						<strong>
						- Only use locks approved by insurance companies.<br /><br />
						</strong>
						<strong>
						- Engrave the frame number of the bike on several parts of the bike.<br /><br />
						</strong>
						<strong>
						- Remove the saddle when you leave the bike.<br /><br />
						</strong>
						<strong>
						- Replace nuts and bolts on wheels, gears, seat and brakes with lockable versions.<sup><a href="#sources">5</a></sup><br /><br />
						</strong>

				<p>
					Several of the measures above are easy to implement, others are both time-consuming and difficult. For example, no one in our project team has engraved the frame number on the different parts of our bikes or switched to lockable nuts and bolts. The list of advices for theft prevention is long, but one can question whether or not they’re adequate.
				</p>
				<p>
					A mere 1,6% of the reported bike thefts in Oslo in 2011 were solved, leaving a huge majority of bike owners with their case unsolved. Since then, the percentage of solved cases of bicycle thefts have declined. The rate of bike thefts which were solved in 2015 was barely 1%.<sup><a href="#sources">3</a></sup> The reason for this being that bicycle thefts aren’t a priority for the Norwegian national police.<sup><a href="#sources">6</a></sup>
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition we’ve checked for existing products on the market, to see if the solution was already out there. We found plenty of different products available on the market, but it was difficult to see how they could prevent bike thefts and leave you with a feeling that you’re bike’s completely secure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bikes can be a valuable means of transportation and an important factor for both your own health and the environment. With electric bikes on the rise, bikes’ versatility becomes even greater. We do however, have to overcome the widespread challenge of bike thefts. Therefore we have designed the first ever, completely hidden tracking system, so that you may keep your bike safe for years to come and in case it’s ever stolen, you’ll know right where it is at all times.
