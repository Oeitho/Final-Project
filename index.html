        <p id="problem">There are plenty of bike theft-prevention products available  on the market. Yet one third of norwegians have experienced a bike theft, so do these products still hold up? We wanted people to start using their bikes, everywhere, without the fear of it being stolen. Therefore, we designed the solution and came up with productname, a simple way to keep your bike safe.</p>

            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>Productname consists of a sensor-activated GPS unit with a transceiver that sends and receives signals via the keyring and app, all hidden inside the seatpost. If either your synced app or keyring is right nearby, the unit’s sensor will deactivate to save you trouble.</p>

            <h3>The keyring</h3>
            <p>A simple keyring comes pre-synced and will notify you via an indicator light if the sensor has detected any notable vibration, with the light changing according to the degree of vibration. If a light appear, you may turn it off by pushing the button on the keyring or proceed to check your bike’s location.</p>

            <h3>The concept</h3>
            <p>The keyring comes with a unique serial number, you may use this serial number to create and sync an account for the app and website. Then, you may use just the app, that way, you may check the notification and the real time location of your bike, simultaneously.</p>
