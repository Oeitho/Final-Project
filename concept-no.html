	        <h2>The productname</h2>
	      	<p>The productname unit is cylindrical in shape and designed to fit inside the seatpost of most bicycles. The upper part of the unit consists of a vibration sensor, a GPS activated by the sensor and a transceiver to communicate with the app, website and keyring after the GPS has been activated.</p>
	        <p>The lower part consists of AA-battery and a plug to hold the unit safe inside the seatpost. When it’s due for a battery change, you’ll get a notification through the app, then it’s as simple as taking off the seat post and plug, then slide out the unit to replace the battery.The unit’s default mode is standby, but activates when sufficient movement is detected and alerts you through the keyring, app or both, showing the significance of movement detected.</p>

	        <h2>Keyring</h2>
	        <p>Productname comes with a keyring already paired with the unit. It’s simple in design and it’s job is to alert you if any significant vibration has been detected. When the keyring is within 2 meters (6.5 feet) of the unit, the unit will remain in standby as to not issue any false alarms whenever you’re riding your bike. It contains a coin-size battery, receiver, notification light and a reset button. The light uses three different colours to warn the owner of their severity of the vibration detected. After the notification light is lit, you may turn off the light by pressing the reset button, afterwards you won’t receive another notification from the keyring for the next 6 hours, unless the vibration becomes more severe.</p>
					<p>
						- A light yellow color with a circle pattern indicates caution and that something has happened to the bike in such a way that you might be advised to have a look, but that most likely nothing has happened.<br/>
						- An orange light with a triangle pattern indicates that something has likely happened and it is advised that you visually check on your bike.<br/>
						- A red light with a square pattern indicates an immediate warning that major movement has occurred and it’s highly advised that you visually check your bike or that you track it through the website or app.<br/>

					<h2>App & website</h2>
					<p>After you’ve registered the unit, you may now log in to the app or website to track your bike’s movement in real time in case it get’s stolen, allowing you to easily track it down. If you choose to stay logged in, the app will replace the keyring completely. The website is solely for tracking at this stage, it’s therefore advised that you still keep the keyring with you if you don’t use the app.</p>
