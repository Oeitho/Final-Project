      <h3>The Unit</h3>
      The unit is circular in shape and made to fit inside the seat column of most bicycles. The unit itself is made up of two main parts.The upper part contains the sensors to detect movement and GPS as well as an antenna.  The lower part consists of the plug and the battery. The plug is used to keep the unit in place within the seat column and is designed to work for a range of diameters.
      The unit’s default mode is standby, but activates when sufficient movement is detected.

      <h3>The Keyring Device</h3>
      The keyring device is a simple design. Internally it contains a receiver and a battery. On the outside is a LED light. This light uses different colours to warn the owner of their bicycles status.
      When the light glows yellow this indicates caution and that something has happened to the bike in such a way that the user might be advised to have a look, but that most likely nothing untoward has happened. 
      When glowing red the light indicates that major movement has occurred and that there is very high probability that someone is trying to steal the bicycle. 
      The Keyring Device is also paired with the unit. When the Keyring Device is within a certain range of the unit, the unit will remain in standby. This is to prevent the unit thinking bicycle it is placed in is being stolen when the owner is riding it.

      <h3>Registration of the Unit</h3>
      When purchased the unit comes with a unique single-use registration code. This code is then tied to the account of the owner. This makes sure only the owner is able to track their unit through either an app or through a website.
      <h3>Position</h3>
      When sufficient movement is detected the GPS in the unit will activate and begin to broadcast the unit’s location.

      <h3>Function</h3>
      The unit contains sensors to detect certain types of movement. If these kinds of movement go over a certain threshold in intensity it will send out to see if the Keyring Device is close by.
      If it is not it will send out the caution signal to the owner. It will also passively activate the GPS for a short time. During this time it will only make sure its position does not change enough to indicate anything untoward. 
      When the unit detects large amounts of movement in the bicycle it is in, possibly signaling that the bicycle is being stolen, it will broadcast an alert to the Keyring Device and activate the GPS. The GPS will stay on until the next time the Keyring Device is within a certain range or it runs out of battery power, whichever happens first.
